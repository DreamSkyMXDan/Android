This includes a couple of models that are used by my apps that are sold to customers.</br></br></br></br>
1. Signature</br></br>
Signature class inherites from relativelayout. It can be instantiated in display mode and user interactive mode. First of all, a signature box will be displayed on the form in display mode and when it is clicked, the box will pop up and change into a dialog where the user can draw signature in the signatureview interactively. In display mode, user cannot draw anything in the signatureview. </br></br>
SignatureView class inherites from imageview where user could draw signatures. In the signature layout, signatureview is a subview of signature. </br></br>
